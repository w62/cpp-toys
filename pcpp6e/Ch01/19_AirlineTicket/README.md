This is based on the examples from P.44 to P.47 Professional C++ 6th Edition.

To compile the module interface file ppm:

```
g++-15 -std=c++23 -fmodules-ts -fsearch-include-path bits/std.cc  -c -x c++ AirlineTicket.cppm
```

It is based on [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76154680/how-to-use-module-std-with-gcc)
This command will generate two things:

- std.o
- gcm.cache

I don't know how to move these artifacts to other location.

There are two ways to compile and link the main program:

- option 1
  ```
  g++-15 -std=c++23 -fmodules-ts -fsearch-include-path bits/std.cc -o AirlineTicket AirlineTicket.cpp AirlineTicketTest.cpp AirlineTicket.o
  ```

- option 2

  ```
  g++-15 -std=c++23 -fmodules-ts  -o AirlineTicket AirlineTicket.cpp AirlineTicketTest.cpp AirlineTicket.o std.o
  ```

  This approach just link the std.o generated by the previous step.

The whole point is to support modules a.k.a `import std;` with g++ 15. Everything is manual and in source.

As at September 2025, I could not get modules working with CMake. I have tried to google and chatGPT'ed how to support modules with module interface file and implementation file. All my efforts went in vain. I don't know how to control the locations of the intermediate compilation artifacts either. As there are only two commands, it makes creating a decent Makefile an overkill. So everything is manual and the compilation is in source. I even need to manually put and .gitignore in this directory.

It is painful yet I really want to have a taste of modules in C++23, so I tolerate this build thing. So here is where I am now.
